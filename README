This library implements a simple set of functions over the Curve25519 function.

The underlying math is a binding to Google's cruve25519-donna implementation.
Please see information about this project here:

You can find their repository as a submodule of this one (in upstream-c) or
on GitHub here:

Their implementation is based off Dan Bernstein's orginal work on the subject,
which you can find here:

Credit where credit is due: I just wrote some wrappers. The authors and
committers for the projects above did the real work.
